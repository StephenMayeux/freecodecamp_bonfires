Hello there! 

These are my solutions to the bonfires at Free Code Camp. Before you dig in and read, please note that I am just like you. I am learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and my solutions may not be the best or most efficient. 

By sharing my solutions and explaining how I have solved the problems, I hope to solidfy my understanding of programing. 

You can get in touch with me in so many ways!
